## About Me
My story with data began in the field, working with Ghana Statistical Service to collect information from households and businesses across regions. That experience gave me a deep respect for **data integrity** and reminded me that behind every dataset are real people and stories.  

I later transitioned into technical analysis, mastering **Python, SQL, and Power BI** to bridge the gap between raw data and strategy. I’ve since worked as a **freelancer**, helping businesses uncover insights and improve decision-making through data-driven solutions.
